what is a lambda function
A lambda function, also known as an anonymous function, is a function that is defined inline, without a name. It is used when we need to pass a function as an argument to another function, or when we want to define a small function without the need for a separate named function.

In C++, a lambda function is defined using the following syntax:

scss
Copy code
[capture_list](parameter_list) -> return_type { 
    // body of the function
}
The capture list is used to capture variables from the enclosing scope. It is optional and can be empty, or can include one or more variables by reference or by value.
The parameter list is the list of arguments to the function.
The return type is optional and can be inferred by the compiler.
Here is an example of a lambda function that takes two integers and returns their sum:

python
Copy code
auto sum = [](int a, int b) -> int {
    return a + b;
};
We can then call this lambda function like any other function:

sql
Copy code
int result = sum(2, 3); // result is 5
Lambda functions are often used in C++ to define custom comparison functions for sorting and data structures like std::map and std::priority_queue.

what is the use of [ ]
In C++, the square brackets [ ] are used to define the capture list of a lambda function. The capture list is used to capture variables from the enclosing scope.

The capture list can be either empty, or it can include one or more variables by reference or by value. The syntax for the capture list is as follows:

[&] captures all variables from the enclosing scope by reference.
[=] captures all variables from the enclosing scope by value.
[var1, var2, ...] captures specific variables by value.
[&var1, &var2, ...] captures specific variables by reference.
For example, suppose we have a variable x in the enclosing scope that we want to capture by reference in a lambda function. We can do this as follows:

go
Copy code
int x = 42;
auto func = [&x]() {
    // use x here
};
In this case, the lambda function captures the variable x by reference using the capture list [&x]. This means that any changes made to x inside the lambda function will also be reflected in the original variable x in the enclosing scope.

Similarly, if we want to capture x by value, we can use the capture list [x]:

go
Copy code
int x = 42;
auto func = [x]() {
    // use x here
};
In this case, the lambda function captures the value of x by value, which means that any changes made to x inside the lambda function will not affect the original variable x in the enclosing scope.

what does capture means i cannot understand
In the context of C++ lambda functions, "capture" refers to the process of making variables from the enclosing scope available inside the lambda function.

When you define a lambda function, you can include a capture list that specifies which variables from the enclosing scope should be captured and how they should be captured. The capture list can capture variables by value or by reference.

Capturing variables by value means that a copy of the variable is made and stored inside the lambda function. Any changes made to the variable inside the lambda function do not affect the original variable in the enclosing scope.

Capturing variables by reference means that a reference to the original variable is stored inside the lambda function. Any changes made to the variable inside the lambda function are reflected in the original variable in the enclosing scope.

For example, consider the following code:

scss
Copy code
int x = 42;

auto func1 = [x]() {
    std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;
};

auto func2 = [&x]() {
    x++;
};

func1();  // prints "x = 42"
func2();
func1();  // prints "x = 43"
In this code, we define a variable x in the enclosing scope and then define two lambda functions, func1 and func2. func1 captures x by value, while func2 captures x by reference.

When we call func1, it prints the value of x (which is 42) because x is captured by value and the copy inside the lambda function has not been changed. When we call func2, it increments the value of x because x is captured by reference. Finally, when we call func1 again, it prints the new value of x (which is 43) because the original variable has been changed by func2.

capture variables from the enclosing scope. what is enclosing scope
In C++, the "enclosing scope" refers to the scope in which a lambda function is defined. A lambda function is defined as an expression, and it can capture variables from its enclosing scope.

The enclosing scope can be the global scope, a namespace, a class, or a function. For example, if you define a lambda function inside a function, the enclosing scope is the scope of that function.

Here's an example to illustrate this concept:

c
Copy code
#include <iostream>

void my_function() {
    int x = 10;
    auto my_lambda = [x]() {
        std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;
    };
    my_lambda();
}

int main() {
    my_function();
    return 0;
}
In this code, we define a function my_function that contains a lambda function that captures a variable x from the enclosing scope of my_function. When we call my_function, it defines the lambda function, captures x, and then calls the lambda function, which prints the value of x.

In this case, the enclosing scope of the lambda function is the scope of my_function, which includes the variable x. The lambda function captures x from this enclosing scope and makes it available inside the lambda function.
